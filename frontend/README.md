This project's frontend was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project mywebsite/frontend directory you can run

### `npm start` or `npm run watch`
Using npm run watch, the frontend will automatically build 
the application for production. This is required since
we're using the build folder to connect to the Django applications
Template... 

First activate the venv for django
### `Windows`: .\venv\Scripts\activate
### `Ubuntu`:  source venv/bin/activate

Once virtual environment activated, you may run the backend using
python manage.py runserver.
